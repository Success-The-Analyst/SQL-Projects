# SQL Projects

This repository contains various SQL-related projects and queries to demonstrate skills in database management and data manipulation.

## Projects

1. **Data Cleaning with SQL**
: This project demonstrates various techniques for cleaning data in SQL. It uses an ecommerce customer database to showcase how to handle common data cleaning challenges, such as:

      - **Handling Missing Data**: 
        - Identifying and replacing missing values in key fields like email and total spent.
      - **Removing Duplicates**:
        - Finding and removing duplicate records based on criteria like first name, last name, and email.
      - **Fixing Inconsistent Data Formatting**:
        - Standardizing phone numbers and city/country names for consistency.
      - **Handling Outliers**:
        - Identifying and capping outliers in the `total_spent` column.
      - **Data Transformation**:
        - Converting string dates to a standard date format and ensuring correct data types.
      - **Dealing with Irrelevant Data**:
        - Dropping unnecessary columns and removing irrelevant rows.
      - **Data Consistency**:
        - Ensuring referential integrity and checking for logical consistency in the data.
      - **Date/Time Data Handling**:
        - Ensuring dates are correctly formatted and parsed.
      - **Validation and Reporting**:
        - Enforcing data constraints (e.g., unique emails) and generating reports for validation and profiling.

   
2. **Insta Data Clone**
   - SQL queries to replicate a simplified Instagram database.

3. **SQL 30 Queries**
   - A collection of 30 useful SQL queries for practical data manipulation.
